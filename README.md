# jpeg-rotator
Windows GUI app to correct rotation of .jpg photos in a folder. Originally developed in 2007.

(Please make backup copies of your images before using; I haven't 100% verified that this application performs lossless rotation, and that it is otherwise guaranteed not to result in data loss.)
